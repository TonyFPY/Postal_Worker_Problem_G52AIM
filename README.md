An Implementation of a HyFlex Compatible PWP Domain

The Postal Worker Problem (PWP) is a routing-type problem which states that given N number of 
postal deliveries, a post office depot, and the postal workers home address, the objective is 
to find a route which ensures that all postal deliveries are made exactly once such that the 
total tour length is minimised whereby the postal worker starts their shift at the start of 
the day at the post office depot, and finishes their day by returning to their home address 
once all deliveries have been made. The problem is similar to TSP domain.

HyFlex is a software framework designed for the implementation and testing of iterative general purpose search methods.
